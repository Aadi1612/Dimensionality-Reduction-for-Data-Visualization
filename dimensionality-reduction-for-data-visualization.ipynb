In general, we should not limit our interpretations to descriptive statistics.\n\nFJ Anscombe has proven this by showing 4 sets of data that, despite having virtually identical averages, variances and correlations, are totally different:\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFS1wg6hiH14Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1543449600&v=beta&t=K9KQZLY4MUBEbzugqEsisOLQh5A9ZsBAOJNIN0z5CI0)\n\nThese sets, shown in the figure above, became known as the [Anscombe Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). Other similar examples (a little more curious) can be seen [here](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats).\n\nIf on the one hand the visualization facilitates interpretation, on the other hand it is limited in relation to the number of dimensions. It is a fact that we, humans, can not see more than three dimensions.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9e28c191196f780b8d4ebf0ff3a0d4150f1c7b2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The problem is that virtually no real problem can be explained well in up to 3 variables.

One such method is [Principal Component Analysis (PCA).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\n\nThe objective of the PCA is to summarize the data through components that best explain its variance. It is important to note that in performing such a procedure, some of the information contained will certainly be lost.
